		<h1>Blade with no Name</h1>
		<h4>By JT Music! ;)</h4>
		<h3>[Intro]</h3>
		<i class="no"><p>Dear Father, I'm sorry that you're not proud</p>
		<p><b class="spar">Sparta's</b> hard enough for a dropout</p>
		<p>You should've watched me fall down</p>
		<p>Hit the ground runnin' -- It's a marathon now</p>
		<p>From marble, my heart's been carved out</p>
		<p>Chiseled the doubt off, vision is sharp now</p>
		<p>Don't bother the bull if you're not into horns</p>
		<p><b><span style="color: red">You're bringing my inner minatour out</b></p></i>
		<h3>[Stanza 1]</h3>
		<p>Knocked down and got frowned upon</p>
		<p>Lost count on how far I've come</p>
		<p>I tower on <i><b>Mount Olympus</b></i> now</p>
		<p>Gods will bow -- Thunderclouds, begone</p>
		<p><b class="badword">f***</b> destiny, it never meant <b class="badword">s***</b></p>
		<p>What's family? I've been neglected</p>
		<p>Tossed off a cliff, left for dead</p>
		<p>This rejected kid just got <span style="color: #fffa6b"><b>resurrected</b></span></p>
		<br><br>
		<p>If I wrote a poem it would be epic</p>
		<p>Take notes, homer -- I'm a legend</p>
		<p>Cuz I descended from <i><b>Leonidas</b></i></p>
		<p>And my touch is twice as deadly as <span style="color: #ffdd00"><b>Midas'</b></span></p>
		<p>One thing you're never gonna see</p>
		<p>An <b class="spar">Army of 300</b> stopping me</p>
		<p>Forger Ephors and Oracle prophecies</p>
		<p>You're not in charge of me -- <b class="god">Democracy</b></p>
		<br><br>
		<p>So far, I don't got a creed</p>
		<p>But stopping corruption is my philosophy</p>
		<p>Geometry -- I've got degrees</p>
		<p><i class="quote">"Smart -- since when a Spartan read?"</i></p>
		<p>Yo <i><b>Herodotos</b></i>, come along with me</p>
		<p>You don't want to miss another <b>Odyssey</b></p>
		<p>I'n an apologist for mythology</p>
		<p>An <b class="person">Artemis</b> reincarnate with archery</p>
		<p><b class="god">Poseidon</b> retired, I got his seas</p>
		<p><span style="color: #f27135;"><b>Hercules</b></span> is a cheap knockoff of me</p>
		<p>Cuz I'm capable of double the colossal feats</p>
		<p>But I don't want a gold medal, <b>let me don a wreath</b></p>
		<p>You're not gonna get a branch from an olive tree</p>
		<p>If you want to start a public argument</p>
		<p>I'll give you some of <b class="person">Socrates'</b> hemlock to sip</p>
		<p>Or <b class="spar">Sparta</b> kick you off this <i><b>Acropolis</b></i></p>
		<p>I keep an eye locked on my target I've got cycloptic focus</p>
		<p>So I won't be spotted with the local drunken, lotus-eating homeless</p>
		<p>I'll be the strongest of any legend to ever become historic</p>
		<p>I am a warrior -- <span style="color: #e3b732"><b>Doesn't mean I'm gonna be heroic</b></span></p>
		<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
		<i class="no"><p>Broken down, shamed and betrayed</p>
		<p>Came back a <b>blade with no name</b></p>
		<p>I feel like changing the game</p>
		<p>Your banal battlecries are in <span style="color: #a60000"><b>vain</b></span></p>
		<p>Fight not for <span style="color: #d1be2c"><b>glory and fame</b></span></p>
		<p><span style="color: #129cff"><b>Vengance</b></span> cannot be contained</p>
		<p>You'll learn too late, I became</p>
		<p>Much more than a <b>blade with no name</b></p></i>
		<h3>[Stanza 2]</h3>
		<p>I'm like a Colossus with no possible obsticle on Earth to stop it</p>
		<p>Have you heard how my <b class="person">Grandpa</b> turned <i><b>Xerxes armies</b></i> into <b><i>Persian</i></b> carpets?</p>
		<p>This is his weapon I wield, earned it -- Then learned to flaunt it</p>
		<p>I hope you all brought a shield -- So I can reutrn you on it</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>Threaten me and I'll respond with</p>
		<p>An effective phrase, in <i><b>Laconic</b></i></p>
		<p>Then just like an ancient toungue</p>
		<p>When I'm done with you, you'll be <b>long forgotten</b></p>
		<p>Now you're in deep, and you cannot swim</p>
		<p>Blood in the water -- Shark fin</p>
		<p>Sight like <span style="color: #325923"><b>Medusa</b></span> -- Locked in</p>
		<p>Ask my last victim -- <b class="quote">I rocked him</b></p>
		<br><br>
		<p><i><b>Malaka</b></i>, hand over the artifacts</p>
		<p>They're family heirlooms, I want 'em back</p>
		<p>Apocalypse -- I should be stoppin that</p>
		<p>Feel like <b class="person">Atlas</b>, I got the world on my back</p>
		<p>Forget the grace of <b>Gods</b>, I already got a great cause</p>
		<p>Restoring <b class="god">Order</b> doesn't mean I don't cause some <b class="spar">Chaos</b></p>
		<br><br>
		<p>With every combatant I've battled as soon as both of our blades cross</p>
		<p>They get the labryinth -- Look on em like they know that they lost</p>
		<p>Predictable story, typical Moral</p>
		<p>Just like when <b class="person">Icarus</b> learned he was mortal</p>
		<p>When I ask, <i class="quote">"You ready for war?"</i></p>
		<p>If you didn't know, it's rhetorical</p>
		<br><br>
		<b class="spar"><p>WHO SEES THROUGH THE EYES OF THE EAGLE?</p>
		<p>WHO SPEAKS FOR THE SILENT AND FEEBLE?</p>
		<p>WHO LEAPS FROM THE HEIGHT OF A STEEPLE</p>
		<p>YOU SLEEP WHILE SHE FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE</p>
		<p>LIKE THE SONG OF A SIREN, SHE'S LETHAL</p>
		<p>PRECISE TO THE EYE OF A NEEDLE</p>
		<p>TITANIC, UNRIVALED, UNEQUALED</p>
		<p>HER CREED IS TO DIE IN A FREE WORLD</p></b>
		<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
		<i class="no"><p>Broken down, shamed and betrayed</p>
		<p>Came back a <b>blade with no name</b></p>
		<p>I feel like changing the game</p>
		<p>Your banal battlecries are in <span style="color: #a60000"><b>vain</b></span></p>
		<p>Fight not for <span style="color: #d1be2c"><b>glory and fame</b></span></p>
		<p><span style="color: #129cff"><b>Vengance</b></span> cannot be contained</p>
		<p>You'll learn too late, I became</p>
		<p>Much more than a <b>blade with no name</b></p></i>
